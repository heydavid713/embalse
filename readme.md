# embalses
Lumen service to fetch and display USGS Water Data for Puerto Rico's damsites as a REST json service.

Inspired by http://mate.uprh.edu/embalsespr/  (https://github.com/mecobi/EmbalsesPR)

I was meaning to write this service for a long time, and now I did it. I hope is useful to some in the future.

Written on Lumen 5.2 and PHP 7.

##To-Do

- Subscription service to notify change in water levels.
